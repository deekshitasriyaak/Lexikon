# Lexikon

Lexikon is an application which helps the user proofread the document and give the corrected word if there are any errors. Additionally, this application also gives the meaning of the corrected word.
It is challenging to proofread for a user who is working on a document while under a time crunch. This application is intended to help these users. It helps reduce the time taken and accuracy of the documents while providing the user with a brief overview of their mistakes.
This application is targeted towards users who write long documents very frequently while chasing a deadline.

The aim of the application is to help the users proofread a document by enabling the user to type in the document or upload the document as a text file, as an input and giving the proofread file as the output along with the revised wordsâ€™ meaning, while using a user friendly and interactive  GUI.
To achieve this we have used Python, web-scraping and GUI.
